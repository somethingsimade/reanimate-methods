# reanimate methods
some reanimate methods i have made or edited for more functionality and optimizations

### methods that replicate from the client to other people

* limb reanimate using currentangle / desiredangle (one axis reanimate): https://github.com/somethingsimade/currentangle-reanimate/
    * pros:
    * limb reanimate
    * cons:
    * R6 only
    * doesnt work with games that use perma death or modify the character too much
    * people with voice chat enabled cannot see it, but if they are in a game that does not support voice chat they will see it
    * needs tools for people with voice chat to see it (not confirmed)
* rootpart reanimate, the real character's rootpart follows the fake character's torso: https://github.com/somethingsimade/rootpart-reanimate
    * pros:
    * replicates
    * cons:
    * only moves the rootpart
* placeholder
